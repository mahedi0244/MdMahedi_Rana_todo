# MdMahedi_Rana_todo
Using Express/PostgreSQL, create a ToDo app. The ToDo app should provide a view that allows a user to add ToDo items and check them off when they are finished.

* You will need a database with a todo table

* Make sure your view has a clear user interface (this can be simple)

* Feel free to push this further (ajax calls, apis,...)

Name your folder/repo 

firstinitial_lastname_todo

j_shannon_todo

Use appropriate git commits, push to GitHub, and submit your link
